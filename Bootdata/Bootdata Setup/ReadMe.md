This application will show you your PC's current state bootloader. The boot.bin file will help you restoring your bootloader
when an unknown virus erased your bootloader, make it unbootable. The cmd will show you with this command: "bootdata". 
Remember you have to run it as administrator. If you run straight to bootdata application, it will also show, but it will 
close very qickly that you cannot configure the bootloader. Also if you don't run as administrator, it will happen like
run bootdata.exe instead of running bootdata in cmd. The "/s" command will save the bootloader into a file. The "/w" command
will overwrite the bootloader, but after that "/w" command you need to write your VM drive name. For more information, type
in CMD "bootdata /?". That's all about the information.
